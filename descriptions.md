7DRL 2024 Item Descriptions

Short-range teleporter unit: While teleportation technology is still in its infancy, this handheld device allows the user to teleport a short distance away to a location nearby. However, the process bricks the device in the process, making it single-use.

Grapple gun: A gun that fires a grappling device that latches onto flat surfaces and pulls the user towards them. These are most often used for navigating in low-G environments in lieu of more advanced equipment.

Body armor: A standard-issue armor vest often used by security personnel. Reasonably effective at protecting the torso from injury.

Security helmet: A standard-issue helmet generally used by security personnel. Provides decent protection against bullets, lasers and other threats.

Automated assault drone: This small drone is armed with an automatic rifle and operates on a basic AI. Once programmed, it will follow the user and assist them in any fights they may get into.

Halligan bar: Originally used by Earth firefighters as a forcible entry device, Halligan bars have still found plenty of use in space for forcing open stuck airlocks.

Emergency stabilization kit: A common tool among paramedics that contains a variety of medical cocktails and supplies to stabilize the badly injured.

Phaser: A nearly ubiquitous energy weapon the size of the average pistol. The lasers it fires can cause burns to anything they hit.

Holo-decoy: This holographic projector can create a lifelike projection of you. In the heat of battle, it’s easy to mistake the projection for a living, talking person.

Concussion grenade: Often known as a flashbang, this non-lethal grenade explodes in a disorienting blast of light and sound when it goes off.

Smoke grenade: A non-lethal grenade that emits a heavy cloud of smoke when it “explodes”. The smoke is thick enough to obscure vision, which can be a great benefit during firefights.

Frag grenade: A handheld explosive designed to split into chunks of metal shrapnel when it explodes, painfully embedding in anyone too close to it.

Bomb defusal kit: This kit contains all the tools necessary to defuse explosives. EOD protective gear not included.

Rope: A spool of high-durability carbon nanofiber rope. It has a wide variety of uses.

Laser sniper rifle: A high-precision weapon for delivering death from a distance. It was created as an energy-based analogue to the classic .308-using sniper rifles.

Knuckle dusters: Traditionally made of brass, these hard metallic rings go over your fingers to make your punches extra painful.

Energy baton: A classic tool for any security officer. When turned on, the business end crackles with energy that stuns anyone hit by it.

Stun Gun: A non-lethal melee weapon that disables combatants with a jolt of electricity.

Plastic explosive: This block of plastic explosive comes with a wire and timed detonator that explodes the brick when it hits zero. However, it can be disarmed with a bit of know-how.

Thermite Breaching Charge: Several seconds after being placed on a wall, this explosive ignites the thermite inside, melting down the wall. Often used by assault teams to create alternative 
entrances.

Stopwatch: Although it looks like a regular stopwatch, this stopwatch is tied to the time-space flux, making it an extremely important tool. Not only does it keep track of how much time you have left for your mission, but it also keeps track of tasks you need to accomplish in order to avoid causing a time paradox.

7DRL 2024 Characters/Locations

Agent Randy: Player Character 1. A tanky close-combat specialist. He began his work as a soldier fighting on the frontlines of various conflicts. His combat skills, even during severe ammo shortages, were noticed by those around him and he rose through the ranks. His special training included close-quarters combat training and cybernetic augments that make him more resilient to damage. 
Agent Maria: Player Character 2. A stealthy ranged specialist. A former agent in the United Space Government’s Intelligence division, she specialized in monitoring and, on occasion, eliminating targets with a minimum of fuss. She trained in the use of firearms and being able to move quickly yet silently.
Director Stevens: The no-nonsense director of the player characters’ unit, who provides important details before each mission.

Villains:

Flint Ironsights: One of the galaxy’s most notorious dealers in military-grade and black market weapons. Often sells weapons to both sides in wars and may have helped stared a few.
Mitch Crawford: A defector from the galaxy’s main government. Formerly a high-ranking agent, they’re believed to be the main suspect in leaking the time loop technology.
Roland Kennedy: A moderate-ranking politician on a highly urbanized planet. He reached his current position by appealing to jingoists and is rumored to be linked to a few notorious hate groups. 
Irvina Schlitz: A scientist with an incredible curiosity… and a severe lack of empathy and restraint. They have avoided the authorities as they performed immoral experiments in highly regulated fields. Getting to field test a technology as powerful as time looping would be the 
height of her career.
Conrad Couli: The head of one of the galaxy’s lead space travel companies, along with several companies that have gone bankrupt thanks to his leadership. His wealthy eccentricity, combined with an unhealthy interest in government-based conspiracy theories, has led him to offer financial assistance to the criminal conspiracy.



7DRL 2024 Story Details

Intro: Countless years in the future, mankind has moved to the stars and conquered space. However, the realm of time is still one that has eluded them. Until now. Deep in the Unified Space Government’s most classified labs, the beginnings of time looping technology are being created. 

However, such a powerful technology always attracts those who want to use it for evil. Thanks to an inside mole, a group of reckless idealists have managed to get their hands on this technology. This group wants to wield the tech on a global sale by selling it to the highest bidder in violation of arms control laws. They hope that this will be the final step needed to bring about the “final revolution” that will ultimately achieve a stable universal government and a world where history can finally, truly be rewritten. 

Given the severity of the situation, the Unified Space Government has given two of their top agents a secret, limited, and local version of the time loop tech to provide an edge on missions so that they can stop the syndicate before it's too late.
